PHCPack-hs
==========

A simple Haskell wrapper of the PHCPack solver for polynomial systems.

--------------

This is a work in progress. Examples and proper documentation will be available in the near future.

TODO:
- Renaming of variables to avoid any interference (e.g with `i`, `e`, ...)
- Useful constructors and functions to build polynomial systems easily and simply as well as shortcuts for things like inequalities
- Simplified API that ignored complex solutions
